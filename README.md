ListViewDraggingAnimation
=========================

This is a simple ListView implementation that supports cell dragging.  It is a slightly more generic version of [Daniel Olshansky's](https://plus.google.com/108153578400873445224/posts) draggable ListView mentioned in [DevBytes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BZIvjMgH-Q).

Note: any adapters must implement the __DynamicListView.SwappableListAdapter__ interface


Here is the original code. [ListViewDraggingAnimation.zip](http://developer.android.com/shareables/devbytes/ListViewDraggingAnimation.zip)
